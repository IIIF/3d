# IIIF 3D TSG Working Space
This repository contains issues recording discussions and progress on tasks for the [IIIF 3D Technical Specification Group](https://iiif.io/community/groups/3d/tsg/).

## WIP Materials ##

- [Draft 3D-Capable IIIF Presentation Manifests](https://github.com/IIIF/3d/tree/main/manifests): As the group works to make consensus determinations on how a Presentation API specification draft could be expanded to support 3D, it's necessary to produce example sketches of "complete" Presentation API manifests that describe the presentation of 3D materials. This folder within this GitHub repository includes our WIP presentation manifest examples, often generated at in-person working meetings. It is likely that these manifests will become better and more elaborate over time, so new users should check out the most recently created manifests first.
- [Experimental Demos](https://github.com/IIIF/3d/blob/main/demo/VIEWER_JSON_DEMOS.md): Part of the work of the group involves creating simple code demo experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of approaches and to show how draft manifests could be loaded. This README describes current demos with links. 
- [Open Access 3D Asset Collection](https://github.com/IIIF/3d/tree/main/assets): To support manifest drafts and experimental demos, we have gathered a collection of CC0 or other open access 3D models for TSG users to use.
