These manifests have been superseeded by new [manifests](../manifests/). The new manifests may be identical or similar to manifests here. The difference between these files and those files is that those manifests may be updated over time reflecting the current thinking and work of the 3D TSG, while these are specific manifests generated at specific working meetings and are retained in the state in which they were originally generated.
