This directory contains draft IIIF Presentation API manifests encoding 3D content. These manifest drafts should be used in demo experiments achieving [IIIF draft manifest experiments](../demo/EXPERIMENTS.md). 

These manifests may be identical or similar to manifests in [old-manifests](../old-manifests/). The difference between these files and those files is that these manifests may be updated over time reflecting the current thinking and work of the 3D TSG, while those are specific manifests generated at specific working meetings and are retained in the state in which they were originally generated.
