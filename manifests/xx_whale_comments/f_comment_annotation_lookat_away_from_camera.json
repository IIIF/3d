  "summary": { "en": ["Camera view obscuring point comment annotation of whale cranium, where comment annotation body is explicitly oriented away from camera. Compared to previous manifests, this manifest intentionally obfuscates the provided commenting annotation. Viewer should render the mandible at (0, 0.03, 0.05) and the cranium at (0, 0.18, 0). This should place the cranium and mandible in something approximating anatomical position relative to each other. A commenting annotation for the hook-like process on the right medial pterygoid plate, the right pterygoid hamulus process, should be placed at (0.04, 0.063, -0.066). This commenting annotation is on the underside of the cranium (basicranium) between the cranium and the mandible, and is intentionally awkwardly placed in terms of view perspective. A camera has been specified, but it faces the front of the cranium and mandible, and does not provide a good perspective of the pterygoid hamulus. Further, the commenting annotation body should be faced away from the specified camera, since the 'lookAt' property has been specified on the comment and it is referencing a point behind and underneath the cranium and mandible."] },
