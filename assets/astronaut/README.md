This asset (astronaut.glb) was originally uploaded by the user "Poly by Google" to the Google Poly 3D model repository, which now no longer exists. It was released under the terms of a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license. The version of the model used here was downloaded from poly.pizza (https://poly.pizza/m/dLHpzNdygsg), a 3D model repository rehosting a subset of Creative Commons-licensed material from Google Poly. 

The asset tipped_astronaut.glb  model was derived from astronaut.glb by adding a rotation defined in the json portion of the glb file. The mesh vertex coordinates defined in the binary portions of the file are unchanged.
