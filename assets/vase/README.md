This asset was created by [Christian Mahnke](), the original item is part of his collection of [West German Art Pottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_German_Art_Pottery). It is licensed with [Creative Commons BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

The background of adding this is to provide a "bad" model as well:
* It has been digitized by a mobile phone using [photogrammetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry).
* Postprocessing has been done in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

It's riddled with imperfections (like a open bottom) and should represent potential results of cost (and thus afford) reduced workflows. (See [Scaling down: IIIF at
small scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NJhcARjZSs&ab_channel=IIIF)).
